# lambro

Hand-drawn Lambro emblems for laser-cutting. Used varying line weights, radiuses, alignments, x-heights, etc to more closely match the handmade originals.

The reverse lambro file has a separate etching layer to mark the stud locations. It's reversed so the markings land on the back of the emblem. On my machine, mounting holes are 88mm center to center. Normal file can be used if you don't want to pre-mark stud centers. Sendcutsend prefers raw .ai files, some others prefer svg.

The serial tag is either printed or chemically etched, then hand stamped with the numbers. We'll see how they turn out, not sure exactly how the originals were made.
