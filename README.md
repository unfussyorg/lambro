# lambro

Hand-drawn Lambro emblem for laser-cutting. Used varying line weights, radiuses, alignments, x-heights, etc to more closely match the handmade originals.

The reverse file has a separate etching layer to mark the stud locations. It's reversed so the markings land on the back of the emblem. On my machine, mounting holes are 88mm center to center. Normal file can be used if you don't want to pre-mark stud centers. Sendcutsend prefers raw .ai files, some others prefer svg.
