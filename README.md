# lambro

Cutting files for the Faema Lambro.

Hand-drawn emblems. Used imperfect line weights, radiuses, alignments, x-heights, etc to more closely match the handmade originals. Originals are made with 4mm thick material. 0.187" is easier to find in the US. Sendcutsend did a decent job lasercutting. I've updated the scale after measuring an original.

The serial tag is either printed or chemically etched, then hand stamped with the numbers. We'll see how they turn out, not sure exactly how the originals were made. Trying frontpanelexpress.com first. The scale is 78mm wide at the blue oval.

frontPanel.ai is the 18/8 stainless panel that covers the front controls. If you remove the gas hookup, etc you are left with unused holes, so I'm trying to recreate it. On my file, the smaller bore is for a custom power toggle switch, so remove that unless you want to do the same. I'm using 0.030" 306 stainless from sendcutsend, which is a little too thick (and not the correct alloy).

Update: the front panel installed perfectly with contact cement, starting from one side and clamping along the way. Looks stock.
